**Wisp** : **W**isp **I**s **S**cala **P**lotting is a console-centric plotting library for scala.
It focuses on existing web-based plotting libraries, and strives to bring the power and flexibility of web-based plotting
tools to the scala console, while preserving an at-your-finger-tips feel readily found in matlab, R, and many other languages.

It is available on maven central. The alpha release of wisp is available as `0.0.1`. An sbt dependency would look like:

    "com.quantifind" %% "wisp" % "0.0.1"
