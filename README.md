**Wisp** : **W**isp **I**s **S**cala **P**lotting is a console-centric plotting library for scala.
It focuses on existing web-based plotting libraries, and strives to bring the power and flexibility of web-based plotting
tools to the scala console, while preserving an at-your-finger-tips feel readily found in matlab, R, and many other languages.
